 Conclusion ANSWERS

Q.1. Why is handling missing data important?  
Missing values confuse models or cause errors. Clean data = better results.

Q2. When should you use one-hot encoding vs. label encoding?  
* Label encoding → ordered categories.  
* One-hot encoding → unordered categories.

Q3. How does feature scaling impact algorithms like KNN or SVM?  
* These use distances—large values dominate.  
* Scaling balances feature influence.

Q4. Compare L1 regularization and SBS for feature selection.  
* L1: fast, automatic, zeroes out weak features.  
* SBS: slower, manual, checks accuracy each time.  
  L1 = efficient, SBS = flexible.

 THEREFORE Preprocessing boosts model performance. Handling missing data, encoding, scaling, and feature selection all matter. Different choices affect results depending on the algorithm.
